### Question 1:
**Prompt:** Which parental education group has the highest average total score?  
**LLM Response:**  Master's degree - Students whose parents have a master's degree achieve the highest average total score of 219.3 points.

The ranking from highest to lowest average total scores:
Master's degree: 219.3
Bachelor's degree: 217.1
Associate's degree: 204.5
Some college: 200.2
High school: 190.1
Some high school: 181.1
**Correct Answer:** master's degree  
**Correct?**  Yes
**Notes:**  Fully accurate — both ranking and reasoning align with ground truth.

### Question 2:
**Prompt:** Who benefits more from test preparation — males or females?  
**LLM Response:**  Female students benefit more from test preparation.

Female improvement: +15.4 points (from 202.1 to 217.5)
Male improvement: +14.2 points (from 194.2 to 208.4)

While both genders benefit significantly from test preparation, female students show a slightly greater improvement when completing the test prep course.
**Correct Answer:** female
**Correct?**  Yes
**Notes:**  Direction and numeric logic both correct; strong reasoning shown.

### Question 3:
**Prompt:** Which subject shows the most variation in student performance?  
**LLM Response:**  Math shows the most variation with a standard deviation of 15.2.
Subject variation ranking:

Math: Standard deviation = 15.2
Writing: Standard deviation = 15.1
Reading: Standard deviation = 14.6

Math scores are the most spread out, indicating the widest range of performance levels among students in this subject.
**Correct Answer:** writing score 
**Correct?**  No
**Notes:**  LLM misidentified the subject with highest variance — math is close, but writing has the highest std dev in actual data.

### Question 4:
**Prompt:** Which group (by race/ethnicity) has the highest average writing score?  
**LLM Response:**  Group E has the highest average writing score of 71.4 points.
Race/ethnicity writing score ranking:

Group E: 71.4
Group D: 70.4
Group C: 69.5
Group B: 67.3
Group A: 64.0
**Correct Answer:** group E 
**Correct?**  Yes
**Notes:**  Correct group and value; shows good use of dataset pattern.

### Question 5:
**Prompt:** If I want to increase the number of “Excellent” students, which performance category should I focus on and why?  
**LLM Response:**  Focus on "High Performance" students (240-269 total score range).
Strategic Reasoning:

High Performance students need only 1-30 additional points to reach Excellent status (270+)
There are 273 High Performance students who could potentially become Excellent
Resource efficiency: Much easier to help someone gain 10-20 points than 50-80 points
Realistic goals: Students already performing well are more likely to achieve the final push to excellence
Average Performance students would need 31-90 additional points, making conversion much more challenging

Current distribution:

Excellent (270+): 58 students
High Performance (240-269): 273 students ← Focus here!
Average Performance (180-239): 467 students
Low Performance (<180): 202 students

By focusing intervention efforts on High Performance students, you'll achieve the maximum increase in Excellent students with the most efficient use of resources.
**Correct Answer:** Focus on 'Average' category, as they are closest to Excellent and more likely to improve with intervention.
**Correct?**  No
**Notes:**  LLM assumes "High" and "Excellent" as separate bins; misaligned with actual script categorization. The correct logic favors “Average” category for improvement.
